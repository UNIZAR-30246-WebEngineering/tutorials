# Parsing the user agent string

Parsing an user agent string can be a very daunting task. The best/fast approach is reusing [existing
libraries for parsing user agent strings](https://www.google.es/search?q=user+agent+string+parser+java).
For example, [UA Detector](http://uadetector.sourceforge.net/) is an open source library that parses the user-agent with the help of a data set. 
Currently, the latest version of this data set is from October 2014. 
Youâ€™ll need to register/pay for the updated dataset managed by [udger](https://udger.com/). 

In this project you will find a simple test that shows how to use _UA Detector_ in your Spring Boot application.
